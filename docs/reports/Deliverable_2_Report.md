**Description of the system structure**

**System Structure of TestVault**

1. Overview
Test Vault helps users create test cases quickly then run them efficiently without missing key organizational aspects. The solution permits all test stakeholders to work effectively through a step-by-step approach for handling test cases.

Our project requires an architectural diagram built on this system description.

Descriptions of all major components and subsystems.

2. System Components

The system divides its operations into different units of work that connect with one another to enhance test case tracking and running.

**A. User Roles & Access Control (RBAC)**

The platform grants role-based permission access through RBAC for different user position groups.

Roles Included:

- Administrator â€“ Manages user access, configurations, and system settings.
- Manager - The manager oversees test activities while checking performance results.

* QA - The QA staff develops test cases then adapts and runs them in QA system functions.
* Dev - The developer checks the tests given to them and responds with their feedback.

**B. Frontend (User Interface)**
The frontend gives direct system access to all users.

* Developed Using: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Thymeleaf.
* Key Features:
  * The system allows users to make changes to their test case records through its Create Read Update Delete actions also known as CRUD.
  * Role-based Access Management
  * Notifications & Alerts
  * Interactive Dashboard for Statistics
  * The Frontend part of the system sends instructions to the Backend API which handles the task requests.


**C. Backend API**
Companies develop the system using Spring Boot (Java) to run it as their central processing unit.

Responsibilities:

* Our solution controls every step of the test handling process from start to finish.
* The backend handles all API communications that come from the user interface of the application.
* Manages authentication and authorization for role-based access control.
* Handles data processing and interactions with the database.
* The backend system connects to both UI, database, testing unit and external integration features.

**D. Database (MySQL)**

* The system database has a regular design with test case actions data.
* Data Stored Includes:
  * Test Case Information (Title, Description, Tags, Priority, Status).
  * Project information (Name, manager, start date, deadline)
  * Modules information (Name, complexity, start date, deadline)
  * The system keeps track of test runs with their outcome results plus time needed and user assignments.
  * User Roles & Permissions (Admin, QA, Developer, Manager).
  * Attachments & Logs (Screenshots, Error Reports, Files).
  * The Backend API gets and saves records to the database.


**E. Reporting & Analytics**
The reporting module enables stakeholders to view data visualization results and requested data reports.
Key Features:

- You can download test results as PDF, CSV/Excel files from this system.
- Displays pass/fail trends of test cases.
- Shows summary dashboards with key performance metrics.
- The system fetches database data through the backend API to show users what they need.

**F. External Integrations**
The system links to other applications to speed up test case management operations.

Connected Services:
* The GitHub platform links with commit functions to manage version changes and test case information records.
* Trello connects with tasks to follow assigned test cases through their work progression.
* The system sends automatic email alerts to notify users about test cases awaiting action plus late tasks and failed test tests.

System Workflow & Data Flow

* The system serves test cases to each user after successful authentication.
* Users submit test case details and the information reaches the Back End API.
* The system backend handles requests by making updates to the database.
* Test Case Engine runs planned tests while data goes into the Database for results logging.
* Users create reports by accessing stored Database data.
* The system delivers notifications when test cases become due or produce failure results.
* Data from Email systems automatically updates to our platform.

Once the user is finished inputing data, then the user pressed a save button. The test case is viewable. </br></br>Fields include:</br>module</br>project</br>test run date</br>review date |1) Would the view of all test cases be another feature? ( **yes, added feature 4**) </br>2) Would the view of a singular test case be a feature?

**2b. Non-Functional Requirements**
**Non-Functional Requirements Table**

| Feature Number | Feature Name | Description | Questions | Priority |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |--------------- |--------------- |
|1| User Login|The user is able to login using an email and password. There is a screen for an admin to create accounts for a user with email and password details.|Is this correct? Can admins invite users or is this not something included here?|High
|2|Performance|Pages will display in under 500 milliseconds or under 1 second. Filter and display of test cases will be under 5 minutes.|----|Medium
|3|Security|Security is handled with role based access control. The separation of developer and admin priviledges means less people have access to hire functions which minimizes the potential risk or attack space. Please see feature 11 for what privledges developer and admins have.|Are priviledges across admin and developer correct in Feature 11?|High
